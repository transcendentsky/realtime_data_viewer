# **App Name**: Realtime Data Viewer

## Core Features:

- Data Reception: Receive JSON data from a client in real-time and parse it.
- Real-time Data Display: Display the parsed JSON data in a structured and readable format on the webpage, updating automatically as new data arrives.
- Timestamp Display: Provide a clear visual indication of the timestamp associated with each data update.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark background (#121212) for better contrast and readability.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) for text to ensure good visibility.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) to highlight important data points and interactive elements.
- Use a grid-based layout to organize data fields clearly.
- Divide the display into sections for timestamp and data values.
- Use subtle animations or transitions when data updates to draw attention without being distracting.
- Use clear and simple icons to represent data types (e.g., voltage, power).
